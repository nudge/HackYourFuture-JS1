## Recap

- Variables in JavaScript: `var`, `let`, `const`, declaration, initialization, assignment
- Basic Data Types in JavaScript: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `null`

## Statements & Expressions

Statements do something.

We've seen some statements last week:
Declaring, initializing, and assigning variables are statements.

Expressions reduce down to a value.

## Loops

Computers are great at executing repetitive tasks very quickly.

For example we may have a list of 1 million numbers, and we want to add them all together. How do we tell the computer to do this? We use loops!

- `while`
- `do...while`
- `for`
- `for...of` (iterable)
- `for...in` (enumerable)

## Conditionals

- `if` & `switch`
- Tenary operator
- Truthy and Falsey expressions
